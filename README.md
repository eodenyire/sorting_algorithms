# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the **0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O** section of the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Tasks
- **0. Bubble sort:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
- **1. Insertion sort:** Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
- **2. Selection sort:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.
- **3. Quick sort:** Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.

## Requirements
- All files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Files should adhere to the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Standard library functions are forbidden unless otherwise specified.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the `sort.h` header file.
- Header files should be include guarded.
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
